# Hospital-Readmission-Patient-Analysis-Excel-Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for the NeighborMart Customer Segmentation Project. The full report and detailed documentation can be found on [medium][https://medium.com/@teddymakau21/exploratory-data-analysis-of-hospital-readmissions-using-excel-9a728c0e691b]
# Dataset
I obtained this hospital readmission dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository,which contained information of 101,075 patients, organized across multiple columns. These columns include detailed patient-level information such as admission details, length of stay, readmission status, medical conditions, and a unique patient identifier used to track hospital visits.
# Project Overview
The data contains hospital patient records used to analyze readmission patterns, treatment details, and factors that may influence whether a patient returns to the hospital after discharge.
# Problem Overview
Hospital readmissions occur when patients return shortly after discharge, and they can signal gaps in care while increasing healthcare costs. In this project, I analyzed hospital patient data to identify patterns and risk factors linked to readmissions .The insights help healthcare providers make better decisions, target high-risk patients, and improve overall patient care outcomes.
# Methodology
I used Microsoft Excel to clean, transform, and analyze the data. The project was completed in structured stages: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, insight development, and actionable recommendations to support better healthcare decision-making.
# Recommendations
The following were the recommendations: 
1. Emergency patients have the highest readmission rates, so clearer discharge instructions and care coordination are essential.
2. Improving  discharge planning for emergency admissions will Ensure that patients leave the hospital with a confirmed follow-up hence reducing the risk of complications going           unnoticed.
3. Schedule follow-up appointments before discharge which  help in  identifying  issues quickly and prevents unnecessary returns.
4. Conduct post-discharge calls within 48–72 hours.Since heart-related conditions have the highest volume, focused monitoring and education can reduce repeat visits.
5. Create specialized programs for cardiac patients. Since Patients who understand their condition, medications, and warning signs are less likely to return.
6. Performing medication reconciliation before discharge by Reviewing and confirming prescriptions will reduce medication errors and complications.
7. Flag long-stay patients as high risk. Patients who stay longer tend to be more complex and may need extra follow-up support.
8. Monitor patients with high medication counts which  often signal complex health conditions that increase readmission risk.
9. Tracking key factors like admission type, length of stay, and medication count will help clinicians identify high-risk patients early.
